<!-- The basis of my idea came from watching Franks laboratory(youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvz_axxWG4Y&t=2406s)html5 canvas crash course. in which i followed the tutorial into 
making the particle system and the code to create said particle system. After i had created the main frame, i 
wanted to perosonalise it by adding my own twists and functions such as reset, colour chooser, and light or dark mode
My colour choices of the default page are inspired by the recent tiffany x nike collab. The context of my work is an experimental art piece
in which the user is able to customize and create their own work using a canvas and a brush that gives a cyrstalize effect. another use for
this code with an easy change could just be leaving a short bubble track behind the cursor for soemthing such as a portfolio, Although i
was unable to figure out how to add functions to be able to change the ammount of particles are dispearsed by a mouse move.

My chosen action was 'click' but within my project i also harnessed mouse move as it also creates something within the page.
on each click there are 500 particles being dispersed onto the canvas and creating what looks similar to a firework-

within my work i have included the slider based on size of the particles, this really changes alot, allowing the user to use the canvas more to draw and 
make cool images, or as it gets bigger the uses change and it becomes more illusion like.
the use of adding 500 particles to the click have allowed me to harness the 'click' as when clicked at a large scale it creates call
patterns and illusions especially with mixing and matching colours.

if i were to create this again i would attempt to add a slider that changed the rgba values allowing more colours and uses. i would 
also like to add one button that would allow the user to choose any colour rather than just red, turquiose or pink.
i would have also liked to look into making the particles stay 3d looking with some kind of colour transformation as the particles get smaller.

the context of the click and the inspiration of webistes such as https://fractalfantasy.net/#liquidentropy have
really inspired me to create this work
