<!-- I copied the orignal svg file and changed the stroke to red, to signify a change in state and was able to apply this to my loop button in js
so that users were able to see if it was red, conveying red, it would change the loop state back to unloop. As there was no unloop icon i thought this
would be the best option to create significance-->
